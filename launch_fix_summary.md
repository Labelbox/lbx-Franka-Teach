# Launch System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Missing lbx_launch Python Package**

- Created `lbx_robotics/src/lbx_launch/lbx_launch/__init__.py`
- This makes lbx_launch a proper Python package

### 2. **Simplified moveit_server.launch.py**

- Removed complex configuration loading
- Removed dependency on non-existent franka_config.yaml
- Now directly includes franka_fr3_moveit_config launch file
- Fixed rviz_config argument issue

### 3. **Created franka_config.yaml**

- Added minimal configuration file at `lbx_robotics/configs/franka_config.yaml`
- Contains basic robot parameters

### 4. **Fixed system_bringup.launch.py**

- Fixed camera launch file name: `camera_system.launch.py` â†’ `camera.launch.py`
- Commented out RViz node that referenced non-existent config
- Now relies on MoveIt's built-in RViz

### 5. **Fixed lbx_data_recorder setup.py**

- Added `mcap_recorder_node` to console_scripts
- Now both `recorder_node` and `mcap_recorder_node` are available

### 6. **Build Behavior Fixed**

- Changed unified_launch.sh to not clean build by default
- Only cleans when --clean-build is specified

## Required Actions:

1. **Rebuild the workspace** to pick up all changes:

   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/lbx-Franka-Teach/lbx_robotics
   ./unified_launch.sh --build
   ```

2. **The system will now**:
   - Use MoveIt's built-in RViz configuration
   - Launch without argument conflicts
   - Find all required executables
   - Not require missing configuration files

## Launch Command:

```bash
./unified_launch.sh
```

## Expected Result:

The system should launch successfully with:

- MoveIt server (with RViz if enabled)
- VR input processing
- System manager
- Data recording (if enabled)
- Camera integration (if enabled)
