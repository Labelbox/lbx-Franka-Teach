# Notes:
# - All versions are unpinned to get latest stable releases
# - This list assumes Python 3.10+ (for ROS2 Humble)
# - 'dataclasses' is standard in Python 3.7+
# - If 'deoxys' is a Python package dependency for any node here, add it
# - 'oculus_reader' handling: If it's a pip package, add it. If it's local code,
#   ensure it's included in the appropriate ROS package (e.g., lbx_input_oculus)
# - Excluded nvidia/torch packages as requested
