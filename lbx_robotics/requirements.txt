# LBX Robotics Python Dependencies (for pip, after Conda setup)
# Use this file for packages best installed via pip within the Conda environment.

# Example for a pip-only package or a specific version:
# some-pip-only-package==1.2.3

# Most dependencies should be managed by environment.yaml for better compatibility.
# This file is primarily for:
# 1. Packages not available on Conda channels (intel, conda-forge).
# 2. When a very specific version available only on PyPI is needed.
# 3. Development tools or utilities that are typically pip-installed.

# If mcap or foxglove-websocket are not found on Conda channels, uncomment them here:
# mcap
foxglove-websocket

# Python 3.10+ compatible packages (latest versions)

# Core data processing
numpy
scipy
opencv-python
pyyaml

# ROS2 Interaction (usually handled by ROS environment, good for venv)
# rclpy # part of ROS installation
# launch # part of ROS installation
# launch_ros # part of ROS installation

# Communication & Networking
# protobuf is managed by conda (environment.yaml)
websocket-client
websockets
requests
pyzmq
psutil

# Vision & Sensors
pyrealsense2

# Data Recording & Visualization
blosc

# Development & Code Quality
black
flake8

# empy is managed by conda (environment.yaml)

# Notes:
# - All versions are unpinned to get latest stable releases
# - This list assumes Python 3.10+ (for ROS2 Humble)
# - 'dataclasses' is standard in Python 3.7+
# - If 'deoxys' is a Python package dependency for any node here, add it
# - 'oculus_reader' handling: If it's a pip package, add it. If it's local code,
#   ensure it's included in the appropriate ROS package (e.g., lbx_input_oculus)
# - Excluded nvidia/torch packages as requested
