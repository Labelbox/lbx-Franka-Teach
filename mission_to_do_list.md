# Mission To-Do List

## Completed ‚úÖ

[x] Convert VR server to async
- ‚úÖ Achieved 40Hz recording rate (6x improvement from 6.6Hz)
- ‚úÖ Implemented 5-thread architecture with non-blocking operation
- ‚úÖ Added predictive control for smooth teleoperation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation (ASYNC_ARCHITECTURE_README.md)
- ‚úÖ Added hot reload feature for development
- ‚úÖ Performance mode with doubled frequency and increased gains
- ‚úÖ Data verification after recording

[x] Hardware Improvements
- ‚úÖ Snug the Franka FR3 hand to the joint (adjusted URDF with xyz_ee offset and rotation)
  - Final configuration: 110mm closer (offset: -0.110m) with -45¬∞ rotation (45¬∞ CCW)
  - Created adjustment tools: apply_hand_offset.py, patch_mcap_urdf.py, test_hand_rotation.py
  - Documented adjustment methods in HAND_ADJUSTMENT_TOOLS.md
  - MCAP recordings now use updated URDF from robot_urdf_models/fr3_franka_hand_snug.urdf

## In Progress üöß
